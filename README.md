About My Website

The project is a website that incorporates a 3D model and interactive scrolling functionality. The main purpose of the website is to provide a visually engaging user experience by allowing users to navigate through a 3D scene as they scroll down the page.

To achieve this, several technologies were employed. The 3D models were created using Blender, a popular open-source 3D modeling and animation software. The website itself was built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vite, a fast build tool for web applications.

For the 3D rendering, the project utilized the libraries @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei. These libraries provide a React-based approach to working with WebGL, allowing for easy integration of 3D elements into the website. Additionally, @theatre/core and @theatre/r3f were used for camera and animation management, enhancing the overall visual experience.

The website includes interactive elements in the 3D scene. Users can click on various 3D objects within the scene, which will redirect them to different pages or sections of the website. This functionality enhances the interactivity and engagement of the website.

Furthermore, the project incorporates components such as an animated sidebar modal and a pop-up model. These components add additional visual effects and interactivity to the user interface, making the website more dynamic and appealing.

In summary, the website combines the use of Blender, React, Vite, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, @theatre/core, @theatre/r3f, and framer-motion to create an immersive and interactive experience. By integrating a 3D model, interactive scrolling, and clickable 3D objects, the project provides a unique and engaging user interface for visitors.
